ABS Right-Angle Tubing Length Calculator Widget 📊💻🛠
Welcome to the BAS Widget repository! This repository is designed to help calculate the length of Right Angle Tubing by taking in six coordinate values (x₁, y₁, z₁, x₂, y₂, z₂) and returning the absolute distance considering each coordinate axis. It can be used by developers, engineers, data scientists and those who need to quickly and accurately calculate distances across multiple axes. 🧪📓📐

How to use? 🧐🤔💡
The widget is an interactive HTML form that you can use within a web browser. All you need to do is:

Enter values for x₁, y₁, z₁, x₂, y₂, z₂ coordinates. 📝
Click on the "Calculate" button. 🖱 This will give you the absolute distance across the x, y, and z axes. The result is displayed below the form.
You can keep repeating the process for new sets of coordinates. Each result will be logged below the calculate form.
If you need to clear the form and start fresh, click on the "Clear" button.
