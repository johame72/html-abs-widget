# 👋 Welcome to ABS Widget 📊 📐📏
> This tool is designed to help you calculate the absolute difference between two sets of 3D coordinates. It's perfect for understanding distances in a 3D space, and great for geometry & engineering projects! 📚🚀🔧

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started, you just need to clone this repository to your local machine. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/abs-widget.git
```

Then, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No additional setup is required 🎉🎉🎉

## 💻 How It Works
The ABS Widget is a simple web-based tool. You can enter two sets of (x, y, z) coordinates. The tool calculates the absolute difference using the formula: 

`|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1| + |z2 - z1|`

You can also clear the inputs and the results using the "Clear" button. 

## 📘 Logs
Every time you calculate a result, it will be stored in the log section. This allows you to track your calculations and see a history of your inputs and results.
